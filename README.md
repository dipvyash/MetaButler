## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):

# How to setup

- `clone this repository`
- `cd MetaButler`
- `cp sample_config.ini config.ini`
- *Fill in all the vars*
- `pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt`
- *And finally* `python3 -m MetaButler`

*Enjoy!*

# How can I obtain `bot_token`?

Just talk to [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)(described [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather))
and follow a few simple steps. Once you've created a bot and received your
authorization token, that's it! that's your `bot_token`.

# How can I obtain a `api_key` and `api_hash`?

In order to obtain an API key and hash you need to do the following:

 - Sign up for Telegram using any application.
 - Login to your Telegram core: [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
 - Go to '[API Development tools](https://my.telegram.org/apps)' and fill out the form.
 - You will get basic addresses as well as the `api_id` and `api_hash` parameters
   required for Metabutler's configuration file.

# Database

If you wish to use a database-dependent module(eg: locks, notes, userinfo, users, filters, welcomes),
you'll need to have a database installed on your system. I use postgres, so I recommend using it for optimal compatibility.

In the case of postgres, this is how you would set up a the database on a debian/ubuntu system. Other distributions may vary.

- install postgresql:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install postgresql`

- change to the postgres user:

`sudo su - postgres`

- create a new database user(change YOUR_USER appropriately):

`createuser -P -s -e YOUR_USER`

This will be followed by you needing to input your password.

- create a new database table:

`createdb -O YOUR_USER YOUR_DB_NAME`

Change YOUR_USER and YOUR_DB_NAME appropriately.

- finally:

`psql YOUR_DB_NAME -h YOUR_HOST YOUR_USER`

This will allow you to connect to your database via your terminal.
By default, YOUR_HOST should be 0.0.0.0:5432.

You should now be able to build your database URI. This will be:

`sqldbtype://username:pw@hostname:port/db_name`

Replace sqldbtype with whichever db youre using(eg postgres, mysql, sqllite, etc)
repeat for your username, password, hostname(localhost?), port(5432?), and db name.
